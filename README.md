# TravelMind

TravelMind is a travel-planning system concept that explores how large language models can support itinerary generation, destination discovery, and plan refinement through a multi-agent workflow.

## Motivation

Travel planning is open-ended, preference-heavy, and often iterative. TravelMind was designed as a project to explore how an LLM-based system could turn sparse user input into structured travel recommendations while keeping room for refinement, transparency, and agent specialization.

## Repository Status

This public repository contains the **system design, architecture diagrams, product screenshots, and demo assets** for the project. It should be read as a design and prototype documentation package rather than a full production code release.

## Project Context

- Product workflow for an LLM-based planning assistant
- System design across user input, orchestration, enrichment, and refinement
- Multi-agent decomposition instead of a single monolithic prompt
- Tradeoffs around reliability, transparency, and iterative interaction

## Key Features of the Proposed System

- Two planning modes: destination discovery and existing-plan enhancement
- Multi-agent orchestration for constraint parsing, recommendation, itinerary generation, and enrichment
- Progressive refinement workflow for follow-up edits and alternatives
- Support for varying detail levels, from high-level recommendations to richer itinerary drafts
- Dual-model enhancement concept for combining structured output with travel-domain suggestions

## Architecture / Workflow

At a high level, the system is designed around the following flow:

1. Collect user constraints such as destination, budget, pace, interests, and planning mode.
2. Normalize the request through a constraint parsing layer.
3. Route the request into destination recommendation or plan enhancement.
4. Generate or revise itinerary structure.
5. Enrich the output with additional details, assumptions, and practical suggestions.
6. Support iterative refinement based on follow-up user feedback.

The diagrams in `docs/architecture/` illustrate the intended backend flow, system components, and data movement in more detail.

## Setup

No installation is required to review the current public repository.

## How To Use This Repository

- Watch the demo video in `docs/demo/TravelMind_demo.mp4` for the fastest product overview.
- Review the screenshots in `docs/screenshots/` to understand the two core user flows.
- Open the HTML files in `docs/architecture/` in a browser to review the visual design artifacts.
- Read `docs/notes/dual_model_plan_enhancement.md` for the enhancement design note.

## Example Review Flow

The fastest way to understand the project is:

1. Read this README for context.
2. Watch `docs/demo/TravelMind_demo.mp4`.
3. Scan the four product screenshots below.
4. Open `docs/architecture/architecture_diagram.html`.
5. Review `docs/notes/dual_model_plan_enhancement.md`.

## Demo / Screenshots

The demo video and screenshots show the main user journey from input to structured travel output.

Included assets:

- Discovery mode input:
  `docs/screenshots/discover_interface.png`
- Discovery mode result:
  `docs/screenshots/discover_result.png`
- Existing-plan enhancement input:
  `docs/screenshots/plan_interface.png`
- Existing-plan enhancement result:
  `docs/screenshots/plan_result.png`
- End-to-end demo video:
  `docs/demo/TravelMind_demo.mp4`

What the demo highlights:

- destination discovery from sparse travel preferences
- structured itinerary generation with warnings, pacing, and match scoring
- plan enhancement for users who already have a rough travel outline

## Results / Evaluation

This repository does not claim production metrics or benchmark results. The current public materials focus on:

- an AI product interface and end-to-end user flow
- the system concept and planning modes
- the multi-agent planning workflow
- implementation notes and design tradeoffs

## Future Improvements

- add the actual backend and frontend implementation, if available
- include a minimal runnable prototype for one end-to-end flow
- add sample prompts, example inputs, and example outputs
- document the agent prompts, orchestration logic, and evaluation criteria
- document design tradeoffs, limitations, and failure modes more explicitly

## Tech Stack

The documented system design references:

- Python / Flask for backend services
- React / Next.js for frontend delivery
- OpenAI models for structured itinerary generation
- Hugging Face models for domain-specific enhancement ideas
